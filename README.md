This tutor was suggested to me by a classmate, Sarah Squyres, and he is a big reason why my code is as organized as it is now. A few days before meeting with him I had an app that was just barely working, but had a lot of bug; Unnecessary syntax, old code that was tried out and not properly deleted. Lots of clutter. He helped me organize my thoughts and figure out a way to take things step by step. <br>
Specifically with the arrays checking action function.

I really utilized the heck out of them this week. I would ask for one small portion of help and they walked me through it. They gave me suggestions on what to look up, what to study on more and what mistakes I was making along the way. I would not have been able to fully make the **local storage** functions work the way they do without them.
